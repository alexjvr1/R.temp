#ddRAD processing pipeline  

This is the final pipeline I'm using to process the ddRAD data from raw reads to basic population statistics

###1. Quality check & filter raw data
  - FastQC check
  - Demultiplex 
      - Optimisation
      - check discard file for recovery of sequences)
  - Filter for quality
  - Filter for adapter dimer
  - Filter for read length
  - QC: nr of reads/sample (& draw graph comparison)
  
###2.1 Denovo assembly (using pyrad)
  - Optimisation of depth
  - Optimisation of clustering threshold
  - Within & between sample clustering
  - Call SNPs
  - QC: sample dropout, missingness, nr loci, comparison between lanes, comparison between populations
  
###2.2 Mapping to a genome
  - Optimisation of parameters
  - QC: mapping proportion, distribution across the genome
  - SNPcalling **Using probabilistic models 
    -FreeBayes
    -Other
  - QC: sample dropout, missingness, nr loci, comparison between lanes, comparison between populations
  
###3. SNP filtering (VCFtools)
  - Optimisation of parameters
    - QC: sample dropout
  - Variatinos in SNP filtering based on analyses
    - phylo, pop gts, outliers
  - QC: 
      - total nr of SNPS
      - distribution across individuals (and dropout rate)
      - SNPs across lanes (and dropout rate - correlate with library length)
      - SNPs within populations
      - SNPs across populations
      
###4. Basic statistics
  - PCA
  - Structure
  - Map of population diversity
  - HWE within populations
  - He (sliding window??)
  - Fst & Fis
  - Fst decrease with nr of samples
  - Fst/1/Fst vs Geographic distance
