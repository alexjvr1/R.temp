#Introduction

Main themes: 

Adaptation to local environment. 


- affect of migration vs selection

- Standing genetic variation vs new mutations

- Important to understand the neutral expectation before we look for selection
  - Phylogeographic history
  - more recent demographic history
  - Current population structure. 
  
- Different marker systems: 
    - Why genomics is useful
    - Genomics as a tool for conservation & population genomics in non-model organisms.
