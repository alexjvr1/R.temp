#Introduction

Main themes: 

Adaptation to local environment. 


- affect of migration vs selection

- Standing genetic variation vs new mutations

- Important to understand the neutral expectation before we look for selection
  - Phylogeographic history
  - more recent demographic history
  - Current population structure. 
  
- Different marker systems: 
    - Why genomics is useful
    - Genomics as a tool for conservation & population genomics in non-model organisms.

#Conclusion. 

Understanding the phylogeographic history is important for our understanding of how the species can track climate change. In cases where N-refugia have been missed or ignored, re-colonisation rates have been vastly overestimated. Thus the species' ability to track climate change is likely also over-estimated (see Bhagwat-Willis 2008). 
(& Svenning & Skov 2007). 

Determining the location of cryptic Northern glacial refugia has implicationson 1) calculating the re-colonisation rate associated with climate change, 2) identifying regions of high genetic diversity.
