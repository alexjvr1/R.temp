#Landscape Genetics

Lots of connectivity/landscape genetics data available across the flat areas, but we still don't understand connectivity across elevation. 

- Variable connectivity across different gradients in the alps. 
- Really high gene flow across elevation in Scotland. 

Other consideration is that high elevation = range edge. So we have to consider the meta-population dynamics. 
- habitat quality (as measured by wetland/pond depth & ice-free period) affects colonisation


Aim:
To determine which landscape and evironmental characteristics affect connectivity across elevation. 
1. Topographic complexity are the main factors resulting in resistence in movement across elevation in the alps. (explains high gene flow in Scotland)
2. Breeding site availability/quality determines the range edge.

- investigate landscape genetics at larger scale in Cope's Giant Salamander. And find that landscape resistance is different in different parts of the range.
