#Ideas for Analyses


1. Alignment of ddRAD data to mitochondrial genome

I don't think there is a full mitogenome available for *Rana temporaria*, but perhaps there are other resources I could use? 

2. I have to check whether the German samples fall into the Eastern or Western haplogroup. And is it worth sequencing them? 

3. Genetically explicit modelling across the landscape & validating with my empirical data

I've spoken to Fred Guillaume. He seems to think that we could do something interesting with my data. I need to get the genetic data, and the environmental data sorted out. Once I have everything, I should go see him. 

4. MSc Project idea: fine-scale landscape genetics across elevation.

It would be interesting to compare connectivity between different elevational gradients. There would be quite a bit of data collection needed: more dense sampling across the landscape, and ecological pond data. 

This paper looks interesting: Murphy et al. 2010 (Mol Ecol).
