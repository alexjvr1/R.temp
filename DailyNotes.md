##Task 1: SE RAD data

- I need to check how well the SE samples worked. 

Currently the H22 & H23 data that I have were from a failed run. (Cathy said there was something wrong with the PhiX). But since I cannot wait much longer, I will use the available samples to see if my PyRAD pipeline works. 

1. Check whether pyRAD protocol works
2. Test mapping percentage to *R.temp* draft genome
3. Compare markers with CH markers. 
4. Basic statistics: genetic diversity and divergence between pops

Available data are from two Skaone populations: SL & Ho
